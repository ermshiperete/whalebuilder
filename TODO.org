* fix permissions for build results
Build results are owned by the whalebuilder user within the Docker container.
It should instead by owned by the user who called Whalebuilder.

* share /var/cache/apt/archives
Docker's Debian images automatically clear out /var/cache/apt/archives, which
means that it can't be shared easily.  We also don't want it to be copied into
the images, as this would take up a large amount of space.  The best solution
might be to instead use a local apt cache.

* allow passing options to Docker and dpkg-buildpackage

* add progress information

* hide output from equivs-build

* don't use sudo if user can run docker directly

* allow base image to be built by debootstrap

* allow default options to be specified in config file

* allow build dependency image name to be specified
